# Tour of Heroes

Welcome to the `Tour of Heroes` codelab. We hope that you have as much fun completing this codelab as we (and many others) had building it.
 
This codelab is based on the work of many people in the Angular community. The idea comes from the Angular site's official [Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). 

## Your First Angular2 Project

This is the first time that many of you have seen or used Angular2. To you we say: **Welcome!** The Angular core team has worked very hard to build a framework that we can all enjoy using. We think that this `Tour of Heroes` project will allow you to see and learn many of the powerful new features in the Angular2 API. 

We ask that you submit any feedback or questions as an issue on this github repo.
